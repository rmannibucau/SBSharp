== Work on the documentation

The documentation uses SBSharp itself to be rendered.

To launch it in watch mode use the following command:

[Ã¸ource,sh]
----
DOC_CMD=serve dotnet run --project doc
----

It is based on `DocLauncher.cs` which is the entry point triggering some generation in `_partials` directory then the rendering of the website.
